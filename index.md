# Privacy Policy — LINE FLIGHT

**Last updated:** February 2026

## What data does the game collect?

LINE FLIGHT is designed to be privacy-friendly. Here is everything we store:

### Local storage (on your device only)

The game saves your progress and preferences to your browser's `localStorage`. This includes:

- Best score (highest distance reached)
- Music and expert mode preferences
- Game progress (e.g. total attempts)

This data **never leaves your device** and is not shared with anyone. You can clear it at any time by clearing your browser's site data.

### Leaderboard (optional, voluntary)

If you choose to submit a score to the global leaderboard, we store:

- **Display name** — a name you choose (not your real name or email)
- **Score** — the distance reached in your run
- **Run metadata** — stage, level, and number of attempts for that run
- **Timestamp** — when the score was submitted

This data is stored on **Supabase** (our backend provider) and is visible to all players on the leaderboard.

We do **not** collect or store:

- Your real name, email, or any personal identifiers
- Your IP address (in our application code)
- Device identifiers or fingerprints
- Location data

An anonymous authentication session is created automatically so that submissions can be validated. This session does not contain personal information.
