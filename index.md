# Privacy Policy — AstroRun

**Last updated:** February 2026

## What data does the game collect?

AstroRun is designed to be privacy-friendly. Below is a clear explanation of what data is stored and why.

### Local storage (on your device only)

The game saves certain progress and preferences locally on your device. This includes:

- Best score (highest distance reached)
- Music and expert mode preferences
- Game progress (e.g. total attempts)

This data is stored locally and **does not leave your device**. You can remove it at any time by clearing the app's data from your device settings.

### Leaderboard (optional, voluntary)

If you choose to submit a score to the global leaderboard, we store:

- **Display name** — a name you choose (not your real name or email)
- **Score** — the distance reached in your run
- **Run metadata** — stage, level, and number of attempts for that run
- **Timestamp** — when the score was submitted

This data is stored securely using **Supabase** (our backend service provider) and is visible to other players on the public leaderboard.

We do **not** collect or store:

- Your real name
- Your email address
- Device identifiers
- Location data
- Contact information

An anonymous authentication session may be created automatically to validate leaderboard submissions. This session does not contain personal information.

## Advertising

AstroRun uses **Google AdMob** to display advertisements.

AdMob may collect certain device information (such as advertising identifiers) in order to provide and personalise ads. We do not directly access or store this information ourselves.

For more information, please see Google's Privacy Policy:
